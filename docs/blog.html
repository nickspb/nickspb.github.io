        hello world! today i finally created this spa, making simple html pages.
        felt like zen. wanted to automate the creation of posts in html, but
        unfortunately you cannot attach txt files in a js loop. so it seems like
        a good idea to write a script that creates new posts directly in the
        html file, but today i'll pass w/ it and add information by editing the
        .html by myself.
      </p>
      <img
        src="assets/img/blog-01-09-2024.jpg"
        alt="erm"
        class="blog-01-09-2024-img"
      />
      <p>
        also tried
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/"
          >balatro</a
        >
        for a bit. i dont really like card games, completed zero gwent matches
        in witcher 3, however, balatro is fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        now i have to get back to university routine, start consuming discrete
        maths content. probably will pass todays cf div3 round.
