      <h3>coding journey</h3>
      <p>
        started programming since school, but accomplished nearly nothing (won
        smth in 2022 at regional programming competition between students)
        except of basics in several spheres (did discord and telegram bots,
        simple physical models and other stuff), also have some experience with
        photoshop, premiere pro, blender (yeah donuts) <br />
        my current stack is NodeJS (mostly for backend, i just cant stand
        frontend setups), also familiar with c/c++ (<s
          >competitive programming</s
        >
        and SDL), python (dAtA aNaLySiS xdd), sql
